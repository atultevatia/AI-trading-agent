## 3. Sector & Index Confirmation

### NIFTY 50 (Benchmark)
*   **Trend:** Corrective / Consolidating.
*   **Confirmation:** A daily close above **25,800** is required to confirm a return to bullish momentum. Until then, the market remains "Sell on Rise" or "Buy at Deep Support".
*   **Correlation:** Tech stocks (AI) are currently underperforming the benchmark, offering value. Auto stocks are outperforming, offering momentum.

### NIFTY Auto (Sector Index)
*   **Trend:** Strong Uptrend.
*   **Confirmation:** The index is trading near its all-time highs. A breakout here would trigger the next leg of the rally for stocks like Bajaj Auto and M&M.
*   **Caution:** RSI is elevated. Watch for divergence. If NIFTY Auto fails to cross resistance, expect a 3-5% correction in the high-flying names (Bajaj Auto/M&M) which would offer better entry points.
